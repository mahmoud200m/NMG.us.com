						One of the things that we are trying to change is our behaviors as it relates to how will build out our interior environments in Healthcare applications.  The amount of change that occurs with-in hospitals is constant:  most hospitals have a permanent construction trailer on site to be able to handle the reality of their environments not being able to keep up with the need for flexibility.  This is the same message that we have been delivering since 2004 there is a better way to build out our interiors – one that gets away from fixed in place construction.  None of us have a crystal ball – we don’t know what technology is going to look like 2 years, 4 years, 
						<br /><br />10 years from now.  Yet we are trying to design spaces conventionally that are need  to be flexible enough to handle whatever may be coming our way. With a modular solution we can reduce our initial construction waste, but more importantly be able to respond to the need for flexibility not only today, but in the future.

						In the long run, to be the cheapest is a refuge for people who don't have the flair to design something worth paying for, who don't have the guts to point to their product or their service and say, "this isn't the cheapest, but it's worth it." Until now, workspaces were a necessary expense without adding much in the way of business strategy. DIRTT Walls are proven to be a better investment than conventional construction without costing more. They also offer endless individual aesthetic, function and sustainability to suit your present operations and future plans – giving you the jump on your competition in every way. The ability to adapt quickly and painlessly is a powerful business tactic. It isn't just something for down the road. Flexibility is vital during the design, construction and move-in stages of your workspace. Once you are up and running and business demands change, you should then be confident in your ability to adapt without disruption, high costs or time wasted. DIRTT gives you that confidence. DIRTT 's built-in flexibility is designed to suit your unique needs – aesthetically, functionally and technologically.

						We don’t know what technology will look like in the future, but we do know that it is a presence in today’s classroom and there will only be great demands on environments to respond to technology in the future. Do we need to think beyond “Old School” for our future? Are we holding our students and educators back? What does “project based learning” and “student centric learning” look like in design? What could it look like today if we “Do It Right” ? Interactive Technology can be integrated. The third teacher becomes the environment Imagine a  classroom where the walls are an interactive and fun part of the learning solution. Construction designed to be part of the classroom curriculum. The benefits exclusive to DIRTT Walls come in the form of support, accessibility and integration. Horizontal support is placed anywhere on your wall to hang new or legacy fixtures and equipment. Being horizontal, rather than vertical support means you place any of these anywhere along the wall and move when necessary. Each side of the Wall is independent, ready to do whatever you need it to do for the classrooms or lab on either side.

						DIRTT solutions provide the flexibility to accommodate changing needs, and easy access to the digital technology that drives public service. Older facilities can be updated to meet 21st century needs, and DIRTT's design and manufacturing efficiencies ensure the least possible amount of disruption, waste and noise.
						<br /><br />Some of our most beautiful projects are in these sectors. The ability to curve walls, create unique elevations of glass and support everything from seating banquettes to shelves for shoes make DIRTT Walls a great choice for retail and hospitality projects.
