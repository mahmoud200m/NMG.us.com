						21st Century Construction, We are Doing It Right This Time, because last time with conventional construction, the computer power didn't exist to go from design, to real-time 3D, to specifications, to the production floor. Last time 
						environmental sustainability wasn’t tied to the bottom line. Last time there was no such thing as being able to affordably manufacture individualized spaces. This time, DIRTT is giving clients and the interior construction 
						industry a new way to Build better. This time we are doing it right. DIRTT -Doing It Right This Time - creates customizable, sustainable architectural interiors. At DIRTT’sncore is a set of robust interface elements that support
						reconfiguration, extreme levels of customization, and distributed manufacturing. DIRTT’s solutions include DIRTT Walls, DIRTT Millwork, DIRTT Power and DIRTT Networks,  along with cutting-edge ICE® technology, and ICEberg®, a powerful modular vs. traditional construction cost-comparison tool. DIRTT Walls are open to more function and more customization than any other in the industry, giving designers virtually unlimited freedom.

					The first firm established, which would eventually become Inventure Design, was founded on April 1, 1997. Principal Jim O’Neill created a firm to offer interior architecture and design services with the skills of a large,
					 well-established firm while maintaining personalized attention. Utilizing knowledge gained from years of association with larger firms, the new firm would offer cutting edge innovation with an unusually focused attention to detail. This firm’s quality of service descriptor would soon become “attention to detail”, its identifying tag line.

					<p>
					Glass Apps is the leading provider of Switchable Glass and Film, which changes from clear and opaque states on demand. For more than a decade, Glass Apps switchable glass technology has been utilized for commercial, 
					residential, transportation, healthcare and government applications. We are fanatical about delivering the highest quality products back by responsive customer support to our clients and partners. Glass Apps Smart Glass is a laminated glass product consisting of a Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) film sandwiched between two layers of glass and two layers of conductive interlayers. This PDLC film is what allows you to change the visual appearance of the glass from opaque (translucent) to clear (transparent).
					When electricity is applied to the film the liquid crystals line up, changing the glass from opaque to clear. Conversely when electricity is removed, the liquid crystals return to their normal scattered positions changing the glass back to opaque.
